### - useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.

### - useEffect Hook lets you perform side effects in Functional Components.

### - useReducer is a Hook that is used for state management.

### - useContext ~ Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

### - useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

### - useMemo is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.
